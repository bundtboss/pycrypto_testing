# Python encryption testing  
Just messing around with encryption in Python 

- Generate key with crypto_keyget_test.py  
Setting environment variable:  
key=`cat filekey.key`  
export key  
OR  
ssh user@host key=`cat filekey.key`  
  
- Encrypt file with encryption_test.py  
- Decrypt files with decrypt.py or live_decrypt.py
